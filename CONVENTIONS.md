# Code Conventions

Shared conventions for all tskovlund repositories.

## How to read these

- **Rules encode intent; follow the intent.** A rule satisfied by a workaround
  is a rule broken: `any` to "use TypeScript", a docstring that restates the
  signature to "document the public API", a test that asserts a constant to
  "cover the module". When the letter and the intent conflict, do what the
  intent asks and say so in the PR
- **Nothing is maintained for its own sake.** Every line of code, test,
  documentation and configuration must earn its place. What adds no value is
  deleted, not kept current
- **Generate over hand-maintain.** Anything derivable from a source of truth
  is generated from it, with a check that fails when the copy drifts: API
  references from docstrings, release notes from commits, CI matrices from a
  versions file
- **Proper fixes over workarounds.** Solve at the root cause. When a workaround
  is unavoidable (the cause is outside our control), say so in the code and
  track it so it can go once a real fix exists

## Code

- **Explicit types.** The reader never guesses a type: full annotations in
  Python, no `var` in C#, no `auto` where the type is not obvious. Escape
  hatches (`Any`, `any`, casts) only at true boundaries such as JSON, and
  narrowed immediately
- **Full names.** `measure_index` not `m`, `exception` not `exc`, `message`
  not `msg`. Intent is read, not inferred
- **No magic constants.** Ports, protocol versions, error codes, timeouts are
  named
- **One source of truth.** Shared logic lives in one place; prefer a base
  class or a shared function over copy-paste
- **Single responsibility.** A file, class or function does one thing; an
  interface exists where it decouples something that varies
- **Comments and docstrings explain semantics**: what a value means, which
  constraints hold, why the code does what it does. They never retell what
  the signature already says
- **Idempotency.** Scripts, migrations and deployments are safe to run twice
- **Tooling enforces the mechanical rules**: import order, formatting,
  linting, type checking, no debug printing (`no-console`, Ruff `T20`).
  Warnings fail CI; a warning that stays becomes invisible

## Configuration

- **Externalize what varies by environment or that users may change**;
  hardcode what is truly constant
- **Pick the mechanism for the situation**: environment variables for secrets
  and deployment, config files for complex settings, CI variables for
  build-time values

## Errors and resilience

- **Surface problems.** Errors are visible, never swallowed
- **Validate at boundaries** (API inputs, external data); trust internal code
- **Structured logging** through the platform's logging framework, with
  consistent levels
- **Retry policies come from a library** (tenacity, Polly). A single bounded
  reconnect that a protocol calls for is fine; a homebrew retry loop with
  backoff is not

## APIs

- **Predictable and consistent**: one naming scheme, one error shape, one
  return convention across every endpoint or tool
- **Version deliberately.** Whether versioning adds value depends on the
  technology; make it a decision, not a default

## Dependencies

- **Battle-tested libraries for problems with known edge cases** (auth,
  retries, serialization); **no dependency for a few lines of our own code**
- **Vet before adding**: maintenance activity, security record, transitive
  dependency count. Ask the maintainer when unsure
- **Lockfiles committed** (`uv.lock`, `package-lock.json`, `flake.lock`)
- **Direct dependencies pinned to compatible ranges with a major upper bound**
  (`"websockets>=14.0,<15"`, `"^14.0.0"`), so Renovate produces reviewable PRs
  instead of silent breakage. GitHub Actions pinned to a commit SHA with a
  version comment
- **Renovate and CodeQL in CI** where available. No secrets in code

## Testing

- **Cover the critical paths.** A test exists to catch a specific regression:
  every behavior a user would notice failing, every error path production can
  hit, every edge case that has bitten. A coverage percentage is not a goal
- **Every test earns its place.** No trivial tests, no tests of library
  behavior, no assertions on constants. Shared logic is tested once, not per
  subclass
- **Unit tests are fast and offline**; they work on a plane
- **Integration tests exercise the real thing** (a real MuseScore, a real
  database via Testcontainers) where a mock cannot catch the failure that
  matters. They are separate and opt-in so the fast loop stays fast
- **Naming and shape**: `test_<action>_<expected outcome>`, cased per
  language; Arrange / Act / Assert
- **One gate, identical locally and in CI**: lint, format, typecheck and tests
  behind one command (`devbox run check`, `mix precommit`, whatever the repo's
  tooling provides). Dev shells (Devbox, Nix) make the tooling identical
- **Archetype minimums**: static websites get accessibility checks (axe) and
  end-to-end navigation; Lean projects get `lake test` and a no-`sorry` check;
  Nix configurations get `nix flake check --all-systems`

## Git and releases

- **Conventional commits**, enforced by the shared `commit-msg` hook:
  `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`, `style`, `perf`,
  `build`, `revert`, with an optional scope
- **Branch, PR, required checks, squash merge** is the default; one small PR
  per change. A personal configuration repo may allow direct pushes to `main`;
  that is a per-repo ruleset decision, made deliberately
- **Releases are tags** (`vX.Y.Z`, semver, `0.x` until the API is stable).
  Release notes live on the GitHub release: drafted from the conventional
  commits since the previous tag, curated by hand, published once. No
  hand-maintained changelog file

## Documentation

- **Docs state what the code does not.** Rationale, constraints, how to
  operate the thing. Anything derivable is generated (see above). No counts
  or version lists that drift; describe or point at the source instead
- **Diataxis as a thinking tool**: tutorial, how-to, reference, explanation.
  Not a filing system
- **README sells, `docs/` teaches.** The README says what the project is,
  why it matters, and gets a reader running in a few commands. Details live in
  `docs/` and are linked; a small repo may need no `docs/`
- **CONTRIBUTING.md when external contributors are expected**: dev setup,
  the gate, the PR process; it links to CONVENTIONS.md rather than restating
  it
- **Author section at the bottom of every README**:
  `Name — [site](url) · [email](mailto:email)`, followed by a License section
  in licensed repos

## Repositories

- **Language conventions apply** (`src/` layout in Python, the framework's
  structure elsewhere)
- **AGENTS.md in every repo** holds the instructions for AI agents (Claude
  Code reads it directly; no CLAUDE.md symlink). Repos are de-personalized
  factsheets; kammer's AGENTS.md is the deliberate exception, an
  owner-specific operations manual
- **Shared CI via `tskovlund/.github`**: reusable workflows instead of
  duplicated configuration
- **Conventions are synced into each repo** as its CONVENTIONS.md, general
  plus the repo's language modules, so every contributor and agent sees them
  without leaving the repo

<!-- Language-specific conventions are appended per-repo by the sync workflow -->

## TypeScript / JavaScript

- **Strict typescript-eslint** — `tseslint.configs.strict` as baseline
- **No `any`.** `unknown` at boundaries, narrowed with type guards; `as`
  casts only where the type system cannot follow and a comment says why
- **Explicit return types** — `explicit-function-return-type` and
  `explicit-module-boundary-types` on all `.ts` files
- **Naming convention** — enforced via `@typescript-eslint/naming-convention`:
  `camelCase` variables/functions, `PascalCase` types, `UPPER_CASE` constants
- **Import sorting** — `@ianvs/prettier-plugin-sort-imports` in Prettier
- **Prettier** for formatting — with `eslint-config-prettier` to avoid
  conflicts
