# Code Conventions

Shared conventions for all tskovlund repositories.

## Code Quality

- **Explicit types whenever possible** — full type annotations in Python, no
  `var` in C#, no `auto` where the type isn't obvious. The reader should never
  have to guess a type
- **Proper fixes over workarounds.** Solve at the root cause. If a hack is
  unavoidable (something outside our control), track it so it can be replaced
  when a proper solution is available
- **No magic constants** — named constants for ports, protocol versions, error
  codes. Every literal value must be self-documenting
- **No DRY violations** — extract shared logic into a single source of truth.
  Prefer a base class or utility over copy-paste
- **Single responsibility** — each file and class has one clear purpose
- **Clean APIs / interface abstractions** — decouple code when valuable and
  appropriate
- **Full variable names** — `measure_index` not `m`, `connection` not `conn`.
  Intent should be readable, not inferred from abbreviations
- **No shorthand** — `exception` not `exc`, `message` not `msg`, `response`
  not `resp`
- **Idempotency** — scripts, migrations, and deployments must be safe to run
  twice
- **Sorted imports** — enforce automatically via tooling (Prettier plugin,
  Ruff `isort`, etc.). Order: built-in → third-party → internal aliases →
  relative, with blank lines between groups
- **No debug logging in production code** — no `console.log`, `print()`,
  `Debug.Log`, etc. Use proper logging frameworks or remove before commit.
  Enforce via linter (`no-console`, Ruff `T20`)

## Configuration

- **Externalize values that vary by environment or that users may need to
  change.** Hardcode what is truly constant
- **Choose the right configuration mechanism for the situation** — env vars for
  secrets and deployment, config files for complex settings, CI variables for
  build-time values

## Error Handling & Resilience

- **Surface problems, don't swallow them** — errors should be visible, not
  silently ignored
- **Validate data** — at system boundaries, API inputs, external data. Trust
  internal code
- **Proper retry patterns** — use battle-tested libraries (Polly/.NET,
  tenacity/Python, EF Core built-in retries) instead of homebrew retry loops
- **Structured logging** — use proper logging frameworks (`logging` in Python,
  Serilog/.NET, etc.) with consistent log levels (DEBUG/INFO/WARN/ERROR). No
  print debugging in production code
- **Fail CI on warnings** — warnings that persist become invisible. Either fix
  them or explicitly suppress with justification

## API Design

- **Predictable and consistent** — consistent naming, consistent error shapes,
  consistent return types. If one endpoint returns `{"error": "..."}`, all
  endpoints do
- **Version APIs deliberately** — whether versioning adds value depends on the
  technology and situation. Make it a conscious decision, not a default or an
  afterthought

## Library Usage

- **Battle-tested libraries for complex problems** — don't reinvent auth, retry
  logic, serialization, or anything with known edge cases
- **Skip trivial dependencies** — if a few lines of our own code solve the same
  problem, the dependency isn't worth it
- **Vet before adding** — check maintenance activity, security track record,
  and transitive dependency count
- **Discuss with the maintainer if unsure** — the right call isn't always
  obvious

## Dependencies & Security

- **Lockfiles always committed** — `uv.lock`, `package-lock.json`,
  `flake.lock`, etc. Reproducible builds
- **Pin direct dependencies to compatible ranges with major version upper
  bounds** — allow minor/patch updates, block major version bumps. Automated
  dependency tools (Dependabot, Renovate) handle bumps; upper bounds ensure they
  produce reviewable PRs instead of silent breakage. Examples:
  - Python: `"websockets>=14.0,<15"` (not `">=14.0"`)
  - Node: `"^14.0.0"` in `package.json` (caret is the default and correct)
  - Nix flakes: `follows` pins; lockfile is the version constraint
  - GitHub Actions: pin to commit SHA with version comment (e.g.
    `actions/checkout@<sha> # v6`)
- **CodeQL scanning in CI** when available
- **Dependabot/Renovate** for automated dependency updates when available
- **No secrets in code** — env vars or secret managers. `.env` files gitignored

## Testing

### Test Design

- **Naming:** `test_<action>_<expected_outcome>`
- **Structure:** Arrange / Act / Assert comments in every test
- **Lean:** every test must earn its place. No trivial tests, no tests of
  library/built-in functionality
- **No duplication:** shared logic tested once in the base, not per subclass
- **Complete coverage:** every error path, edge case, and branching condition
  that could fail in production
- **Integration tests alongside unit tests** — unit tests verify components in
  isolation, integration tests verify outcomes end-to-end. Both complement each
  other

### Universal Rules

- **`make check` as universal validation gate** — lint + typecheck + test. Must
  pass before any commit is merged. Same command runs locally and in CI
- **`make test` for fast feedback** — unit tests only, runs in seconds
- **`make test-integration` for container-based tests** — separated from unit
  tests so the fast loop stays fast
- **Offline-capable unit tests** — no network calls, mock external APIs. Unit
  tests must work on a plane
- **CI parity** — developers run the exact same commands locally that CI runs.
  Devbox or Nix dev shells ensure identical tooling everywhere. No "works on my
  machine" gaps

### Per-Archetype Minimum Test Types

| Archetype | Test types |
|-----------|-----------|
| Python library/tool (cambr, mcp-score) | Unit (pytest), property-based (hypothesis) for pure functions |
| Static website (skovlund.dev) | A11y (Playwright + axe-core, blocking), E2E navigation (Playwright), visual regression (`toHaveScreenshot()`, non-blocking initially) |
| Nix configuration (nix-config) | `nix flake check --all-systems` |

### Integration Test Infrastructure

- **Testcontainers for container-based integration tests** — add only when repos
  interact with external services (databases, message brokers, APIs)
- **Dev shells set Podman env vars** — `DOCKER_HOST`,
  `TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_DISABLED` configured in Nix dev shells so Testcontainers
  works with Podman out of the box

## Git & Workflow

- **Conventional commits** — `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`,
  `chore:`
- **Direct to main** for small changes, **branch + PR** for structural work
- **PR review loop** before merge on structural changes

## Documentation

- **Diataxis framework** — tutorials, how-to guides, reference, explanation.
  Use it as a thinking tool when writing docs, not a rigid filing system
- **README as landing page** — what the project is, why it matters, quick start
  (3–5 commands). Keep it lean. The README sells, `docs/` teaches
- **Detailed docs in `docs/`** — getting started, architecture, reference, and
  how-to guides live in `docs/` and are linked from the README. For small repos
  where the README already covers everything, `docs/` is not required
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** when external contributors are expected — references
  CONVENTIONS.md for standards, covers dev setup and PR process
- **Author section at the bottom of every README** — always present. Licensed
  repos also have a License section (linking to the LICENSE file) after it

## Project Structure

- **Follow established conventions per language/framework** — `src/` layout in
  Python, standard framework structures elsewhere
- **AGENTS.md in every repo** with a CLAUDE.md symlink — the canonical file for
  AI agent instructions
- **Shared CI via `tskovlund/.github`** — reusable workflows for common
  patterns. Repos reference shared workflows instead of duplicating CI
  configuration
- **Automate enforcement** — CI checks, pre-commit/pre-push hooks, linting,
  and type checking should enforce every rule that can be checked automatically
- **Conventions belong in the repo** — each repo includes the relevant subset
  of these conventions in its own docs. Redundancy across repos is intentional
  so that every contributor picks them up

## TypeScript / JavaScript

- **Strict typescript-eslint** — `tseslint.configs.strict` as baseline
- **Explicit return types** — `explicit-function-return-type` and
  `explicit-module-boundary-types` on all `.ts` files
- **Naming convention** — enforced via `@typescript-eslint/naming-convention`:
  `camelCase` variables/functions, `PascalCase` types, `UPPER_CASE` constants
- **Import sorting** — `@ianvs/prettier-plugin-sort-imports` in Prettier
- **Prettier** for formatting — with `eslint-config-prettier` to avoid
  conflicts
