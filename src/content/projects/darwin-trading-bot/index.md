An experimental trading bot that uses genetic algorithms to evolve and optimize trading strategies. The novel approach: AI coding agents serve as mutation operators, generating and refining strategy code through natural selection.

Currently in the research and design phase — evaluating agent orchestration patterns and genetic algorithm architectures.
