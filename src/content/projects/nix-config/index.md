Fully declarative personal computing environment using Nix flakes. Manages everything from shell config and editor setup to macOS system defaults, Homebrew casks, and secrets (via agenix).

Supports macOS (nix-darwin), standalone Linux (home-manager), and NixOS-WSL — all from a single repo with base/personal profile splitting for portability.

Built with AI-augmented workflows: Claude Code agent teams, automated CI, and comprehensive git hooks.
